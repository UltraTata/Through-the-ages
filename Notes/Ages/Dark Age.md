**Bandits**
The bandit crisis starts with a strength of 1. Every turn, ==after== drawing a leader, the bandits will attack the affected nation with their strength as attack points. If they are successful, they will deplete the affected nation of all their coins.

**Earthquake**
When an earthquake occurs, all buildings will be destroyed. However, the nation can conserve any buildings they want if they immediately pay half their cost for reconstruction and maintenance.

**Hopelessness**
The hopelessness crisis starts with a strength of 1. Every turn, ==after== drawing a leader, a debate will take place, the hopelessness with its strength as proselytism against the affected version. If depression wins, half the population belonging to the nation will convert to another nation. Which populations convert and to which nation is the affected player's choice. After that, the crisis ends.

**Rebellion**
The rebellion starts with a strength of 1. Every turn, ==after== drawing a leader, the rebels will subvert the order of the affected nation: -1 jade point per strength point of the rebellion. If the nation can't pay the jade, they loose all their law and technology but the rebellion ends.
