A civilization is a chain of 6 [[Nation|nations]] that the same player will control, one nation per era.

Because unique [[Building|buildings]] and [[Heritage|heritage]] belongs to nations rather than civilization but are conserved through the ages, players must think how their decisions will impact the next era as they won't have a second chance.
