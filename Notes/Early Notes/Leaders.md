See: [[Leader]]

Each card could represent a great person that allows for an action. There would be a base deck and then special people based on nation or age-specific [[Achievement|achievement]]. For example: Conqueror: Spend X + Y soldiers to destroy a nations' army and conquer part of their population. X being the nation's army size and Y being the population conquered. Recruiter: Earn a soldier per population of your nation or conquered population, apply modifiers. Architect: Spend the gold needed to build a building. The currencies could be: Soldiers Gold Stability (political capital) Piety (cultural-intellectual capital) However, the use of these resources depends on the great person deck of each nation as well as the modifiers. For example, a nation may have a lot of piety but be unable to convert populations because they have too few or no missionaries.
