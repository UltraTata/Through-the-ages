Attack refers to spending [[Coins|iron]] to destroy iron of another player in a 1:1 ration ==regarding== attack and defense bonuses.

**Attack multiplicative bonus**: Multiplies the effect of each iron spent on the attack. For example, a x2 attack bonus makes me destroy 2 enemy iron for each 1 I spend.
**Attack additive bonus**: Adds a fix number of "ghost iron" spent in the attack. For example, in the absence of other effects, if I have a +3 attack bonus and I spend 5 iron in the attack, I would destroy 8 enemy iron.
**Defense multiplicative bonus**: Multiplies the cost of each iron spent on the attack. For example, a x2 defense bonus makes the enemy spend 2 iron for each 1 that they destroy.
**Defense additive bonus**: Adds a fix number of "ghost iron" that the enemy must destroy first. For example, if the opponent spend 5 iron in the attack and I have a +2 defense bonus, I only lose 3 iron.

There is only one chance of declaring how much iron is spent on the attack. For example:
- Defensor: 5 iron + a reactive leader (which gives +2 defense bonus when attacked)
- Attacker: Spends 5 iron on the attack
- Then the reactive leader is revealed so the defensor still has 2 iron left
- The attacker cannot spend 2 more iron to finish him off. He must wait for another aggressive leader.
