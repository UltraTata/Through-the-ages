See: [[/Early Notes/Leaders|Early Notes]]

Each player has their own deck of cards. Each card represents a leader, political or otherwise, that will make reality his project. Each [[Age|age]] has one or more base decks to which nations and other factors add additional leaders. Leaders can have special traits:

- **Unique** leaders are not sent to the reshuffling pile after being player. Rather, they are discarded. When a unique leader is drawn, the player may chose to skip them, sending them to the reshuffling pile and drawing another card.
- **Reactive** leaders are not shown nor played immediately. Rather, the turn is lost but the player keeps the leader in their hand. The leader will be played outside their turn as a reaction to some event.
- **Mandatory** leaders must be activated even if perjudicial.
- etc.

The player is free to shuffle the reshuffling pile alongside the deck whenever they want as long as the method ensures randomness.

Instead of drawing a leader card, a player may chose to declare [[Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]].
