A nation is a historical period of a [[Civilization|civilization]]. A player will control a nation for exactly one [[Age|age]]. Each nation can only exist in its age and within its civilization.

A nation has the following:
- A name
- A civilization it is part of
- An age during which it exists
- A set of skills (see below)
- A set of unique [[Achievement|achievements]] it can reach
- A unique [[Heritage|heritage]] it can adopt
- A set of unique [[Law|laws]] it can enact
- A set of unique [[Building|buildings]] it can construct
- A set of [[Leader|leaders]] it adds to the base leader deck of the age

This is why nations are, together with ages, the most complex elements of the game.
