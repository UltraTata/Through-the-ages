Each population has these characteristics:

**Territory** in which it lives
**Nation** to which it belongs (which can be distinct from the one that its territory belongs to)
**Faith** that it practices (only during [[Age of Faith]])

The nation that controls the territory in which a population lives is their **Overlord** and it is said to "control" that population.
The nation that a population belongs to is thier **Nation** and it is said to "have" or "own" them.
