Stability is a number that allows you to skip undesired [[Leader|leaders]] to speed up the game.

By default, the stability value of a player is 0. If they have 1 [[Population|population]] belonging to its nation it increases by 1. If they have 2 the value increase by 2. If they have 4 the value increases by 3. If they have 8 the value increases by 4. Etc. In general, the stability increase from population is x if the national population is at least 2^x

After that, there is a malus for controling population belonging to other nations. This malus follows the same logic as the bonus. -1 for 1 foreigner. -2 for 2. -3 for 4. Etc.

Other elements may modify stability. The "Stability Bonus" and "Stability Malus" refer to the ones described above.

A player can skip 1 leader per turn per stability. Leaders outside the base deck of the [[Timeline|age]] are free to skip (they don't require stability points).
