Coming soon?...
[[Crisis]]:
	There are around 4 crises, one per coin. When it starts it will last an unknown amount of turns. Each turn it subtracts from the coin to all players. Starts at 1, doubles each turn. If it ends in the negatives, set it to 0 follow the instructions of the crisis (could tell you to abolish laws, discard technologies, destroy buildings, kill population, etc.).
[[Inflation]]:
	In order for heritage to not speed up the game as time goes on, the coin costs grow after each played age. The modifier starts at x1 and it doubles each age for everyone except the winner that quadruples it. Inflation affects everything: Heritage, laws, technology, and buildings. Should iron be affected too?
Unique military leaders immune to reactions?
